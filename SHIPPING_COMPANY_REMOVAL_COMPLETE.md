- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed unused code and dependencies

### Considerations ⚠️
- **Shipping Responsibility**: Company now handles all shipping internally
- **Database Migration**: Existing shipping data needs cleanup
- **User Communication**: Notify existing shipping companies about changes
- **Order Fulfillment**: Ensure company has shipping capabilities

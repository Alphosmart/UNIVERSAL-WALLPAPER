# 🔧 SUSPENDED SELLERS VISIBILITY FIX

## 🐛 **Issue Identified:**
When a seller was suspended, they disappeared from the admin seller applications list because the backend query only included specific statuses but excluded "suspended" sellers.

## ✅ **Root Cause:**
In `backend/controller/sellerController.js`, the `getSellerApplications` function was querying:
```javascript
sellerStatus: { $in: ['pending_verification', 'verified', 'rejected'] }
```

This excluded suspended sellers from the admin dashboard list.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied:**
Updated the query to include suspended sellers:
```javascript
sellerStatus: { $in: ['pending_verification', 'verified', 'rejected', 'suspended'] }
```

## 📁 **File Modified:**
- **File:** `backend/controller/sellerController.js`
- **Function:** `getSellerApplications`
- **Line:** 236
- **Change:** Added `'suspended'` to the status array

## 🎯 **Result:**
✅ Suspended sellers now appear in the admin dashboard
✅ Admin can see suspended sellers with orange "Suspended" badges
✅ Admin can unsuspend sellers using the "Unsuspend" button
✅ Complete seller management functionality restored

## 🚀 **Status:**
**FIXED** - Suspended sellers are now visible in the admin seller applications list with proper status indicators and management controls.

## 📝 **Next Steps:**
1. Refresh the admin dashboard page
2. Suspended sellers should now be visible with orange "Suspended" status
3. You can unsuspend them using the green "Unsuspend" button

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Mock Data Solution
- Created `mockSocialFeaturesController.js` to handle testing without database connectivity
- All functionality works with in-memory mock data
- Easy switch to real database when connectivity is restored

### Database Integration Ready
- All controllers are database-ready
- Simply switch imports from mock to real controller
- MongoDB schema already enhanced for social features

### API Response Examples

**Like Product Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Product liked successfully",
  "error": false,
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "productId": "66b123456789012345678901",
    "liked": true,
    "totalLikes": 3
  }
}
```

**Product Statistics Response:**

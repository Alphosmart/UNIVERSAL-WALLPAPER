# 🚀 Render Deployment Fix

## Issue: Frontend Build Not Found
```
❌ Frontend build directory NOT found at: /opt/render/project/src/frontend/build
```

## Root Cause
Render is using auto-detection and running `npm install` instead of the render.yaml configuration.

## Solution Applied
Added `postinstall` script to package.json that automatically:
1. Installs frontend dependencies 
2. Builds the frontend after npm install

## Alternative: Manual Render Configuration
If you want to use render.yaml instead:

1. Go to your Render Dashboard
2. Select your service "universal-wallpaper"
3. Go to Settings
4. Update Build Command to: `npm run build`
5. Update Start Command to: `npm start`

## Expected Result
After this deployment, you should see:
```
✅ Frontend build directory found
```

## Test Commands
After deployment:
- Health check: `https://universaldotwallpaper.onrender.com/health`
- SPA test: `https://universaldotwallpaper.onrender.com/product/123`
